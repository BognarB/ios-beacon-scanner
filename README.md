### Project Description
This app monitors for a beacon region with a specific UUID. Once it enters the beacon region, it ranges for individual beacons, and displays visible beacons in a table. It also works with the Roll Call project by notifying a Node.js server whenever the user enters or exits the region. There are a few things hard-coded into the project: the UUID of the beacons used, and the URL of the Roll Call node instance. These would need to be changed when attempting to recreate the project.
